# FiraCode-Condensed

Condensed versions of FiraCode to be used in editors that render letter spacing incorrectly. For example, [JetBrains 2020.1](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-236687).

The three directoires corresponde to three different letter spacing adjustments:
dist-10 is obtained by substracting 10 unit from the original font, etc.

Only .ttf files are included.
